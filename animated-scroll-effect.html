				<p>Sales is the direct result of marketing and sales data is sometimes even more important than the sales themselves. Why did they buy? What did they buy? When? Who bought? How much did it cost? Then a comparison of sales YTD or Year over Year. This analysis can optimize your ability to sell with WebCorpCo Analytics.</p>
